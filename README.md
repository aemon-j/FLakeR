FLakeR
====


R package for basic [FLake](http://www.flake.igb-berlin.de/) model running. `FLakeR` holds the version downloaded from the [website](http://www.flake.igb-berlin.de/site/download) on 2019-10-25 and should run virtually on any 32-bit Windows system.  This package does not contain the source code for the model, only the executable. This package was inspired by [GLMr](https://github.com/GLEON/GLMr).
